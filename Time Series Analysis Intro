# Time Series Talk- Stationarity

What makes a time series stationary?-
Stationarity means that the mean of the time series is constant
The Standard Deviation is also constant
There is no seasonality (Seasonality is a periodic behavior over time that is predictable)

(If a time series is white noise, we also know itâ€™s stationary)

Checking for Stationarity-
Visually
Global v.s. Local tests
Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF)
